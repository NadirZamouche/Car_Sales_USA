# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the vehicle sales market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint trends in sales, car models, and pricing. The analysis aims to uncover insights such as the most popular models, pricing trends, and how factors like car condition and odometer readings affect sales.


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What's the number of sales in each state?
2. What's the number of sales of each car model?
3. What's the average car price in each state?
4. What's the average car price per month & year?
5. What's the number of sales per month?
6. What are the top 5 brand models for car body type?
7. Which cars sold higher than their models average price?
8. How does condition affect sales and price?
9. How does odometer affect sales and price?
10. Give details for each car brand (number of models, sales, minimum, maximum & average prices).
11. Which same car sold multiple times (more than once)?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the vehicle sales market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

 - **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
 - **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the vehicle sales data.
 - **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
 - **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
